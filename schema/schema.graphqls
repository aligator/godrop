# Node defines one node in the filesystem tree.
# If isFolder == true, files may be filled with children which are itself other nodes.
# If isFolder == true, but the children are not set, they are just omitted and not loaded.
# If isFolder == true, but the children are an empty array, they are loaded, but no child exists.
# If isFolder == false, files has to be an empty array.
# The fields mimeType and file may be unset.
# To be fully flexible there may be nodes which just have a name
# without being a folder and without being a file.
